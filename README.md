## Class Scheduling Using Genetic Algorithm

Genetic Algorithm is an optimization 
technique which tries to find out such values of input so that we get the best output values or results. By using genetic algorithm, we are trying to automate class scheduling problem. Given a set of data that has list of professors, list of courses associated with each professor, list of class rooms available, and list of time slots a time table can be prepared automatically by the algorithm. This information becomes a chromosome and we evaluate fitness of each of them and select best possible 
chromosome and then proceed with crossover and mutation.



Genotype - Room Number, TimeSlot, Professor, Module(Course Name), Group.
